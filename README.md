[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nuclth/Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer/blob/master/Neural_Network_Beginner.ipynb)

A machine learning program to recognize handwritten numbers from the MNIST data set using a neural network. See [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) for more information and the dataset used. For most of the code used in this repository, see Michael Nielsen's [github page](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) or the python 3 implementation by [Micha≈Ç Dobrzanski](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35).
